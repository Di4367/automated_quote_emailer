💌 Monday Motivation Mailer

Every great week starts with a spark — a quote, a thought, or a moment of inspiration. This project is a simple yet impactful Python automation that sends one **random motivational quote** from a curated list of 100 to your email inbox every **Saturday** (you can change it to Monday too)!
