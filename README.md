💌 Monday Motivation Mailer

Every great week starts with a spark — a quote, a thought, or a moment of inspiration. This project is a simple yet impactful Python automation that sends one **random motivational quote** from a curated list of 100 to your email inbox every **Saturday** (you can change it to Monday too)!

🚀 Project Overview

This Python script:
- Reads quotes from a `quotes.txt` file
- Picks one random quote
- Sends it via email automatically using Gmail's SMTP service
- Triggered based on day of the week (currently Saturday)

🔐 How It Works

- Uses `smtplib` for sending emails
- Uses Gmail App Password (secure)
- Quotes stored in plain text, one per line
- Runs conditionally based on `datetime.weekday()` (5 = Saturday)
